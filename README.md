# RAG-Application-Built-on-Gemini
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using the Gemini model for question-answering tasks. Built with Streamlit, it enables users to upload a research paper (PDF), splits the content into chunks, and stores the information in a Chroma vector store.
